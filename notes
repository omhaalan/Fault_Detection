Tomorrow:

Run all experiments on the 10% data. Run the whole algorithm on all 10% datasets.

Experiment with the V_a step respons. Note the reactions.
	1. Keep or omitt peaks?




Results might by new tuning!
Question:
	1. Does the algorithm correctly diagnose a healthy system? 
		Noiseless:
		Noisy:

	2. Is the same true in the precence of noise?

			


	3. Does the system correctly detect an error?
		F1: Without noise: yes


	4. Does the system correctly identify an error?
	5. Test in noisy envioronment as well.

If this works: Generate the 50% dataseries. Check that the algorithm works on the 1% and 50% datasets. Neccesary modifications?

The project is over when this is done.
